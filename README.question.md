# Assignment Rabobank

Rabobankâ€™s software is mainly used to get insights on customer transactions. Within this assignment there is some backend software created to spin up a NodeJS service which serves a transactions file. Create an Angular application where a user can see their transactions in in list (timeline).

The requirements are:
- All transactions should be shown 
- All transactions should be showed grouped based on date and ordered (newest on top)
- The information in the timeline should only show `otherParty.name` and the `amount` in EUR. (Be aware there is some USD as well, need to convert it based on the rate)
- When clicking on a transaction you should navigate to a detail page showing the more in-depth details
- It would be nice if there is some sort of styling (scss)

In addition to the code, consider other matters that you consider as part of your work.
